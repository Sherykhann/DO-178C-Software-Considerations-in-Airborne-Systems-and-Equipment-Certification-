To comply with DO-178C, the following practices are essential:

Traceability:

Each piece of code must be traceable to a specific requirement. In our example, the comments within the code (e.g., Requirement 1: The system shall calculate the altitude based on a given barometric pressure) provide direct traceability.
The test functions must also trace back to the requirements. In the test code, you can document which requirement each test is addressing.
Modular Design:

The code is designed to be modular by separating the altitude calculation into a single function. This makes the software easier to test and maintain.
Unit Testing:

DO-178C requires that 100% of code be tested (often with coverage analysis, such as statement, branch, and condition coverage). The provided unit tests ensure that the core functionalities of the system are tested.
Review and Documentation:

Documentation is required for each part of the process, including requirements specifications, design, test plans, test results, and code reviews.
In practice, all these documents should be prepared and reviewed in accordance with DO-178C guidelines.
Version Control and Configuration Management:

Software artifacts (including the source code, requirements documents, test cases, and test results) must be version-controlled and managed in a way that allows traceability across the software development lifecycle.
