We'll structure this example into:

Requirement Specification
C Code Implementation
Unit Testing Example
DO-178C Compliance Considerations

1. Requirement Specification
The first step in DO-178C compliance is ensuring traceability between the software and the requirements. For this example, we'll define the following requirements:

Requirement 1: "The system shall calculate the altitude based on a given barometric pressure."

Requirement 2: "If the pressure exceeds 1100 hPa, the system shall issue a warning that the pressure is too high to calculate altitude."

Requirement 3: "The system shall trigger an alert if the altitude exceeds 40,000 feet."

2. C Code Implementation
The C code will include a simple function that calculates the altitude based on the barometric pressure. Weâ€™ll also include the logic for handling high pressure and altitude warnings.
